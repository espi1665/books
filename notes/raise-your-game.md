- As a player, I had zero self awareness. Markell fultz story Demath (Frosh,JV, varsity)
- If you don’t know who you are and what you do, nothing else you know or learn will matter
- Recognize what you can contribute - where your value is- and others will notice. And they will reward you for it.

- Failure is learning 
- Happiness can be defined as the fruit of the desire and ability to sacrifice what we want now for what we want eventually.
- Be open to failure - incite failure 
- Passion will separate you from others and your life’s work from anyones else’s 
- Your attitude and approach determine whether it’s a grind or a journey
- Use your passion as a guide to what you should be doing.

- Use your unseen hours. Make the most of your time—those at the top do not waste a second. Focus on what matters.

## Coachability:

- When looking to change team culture - who can move thw crowd?
- Leadership isn’t about forcing others in a direction; it’s about trusting they will want to follow.
- Your people are your competitive advantage. You can copy products, services, tech, but it’s very hard to copy culture. 
- Culture is supported and spread by your people.

- Effective leadership creates strong loyalty; loyalty creates commitment. Commitment strengthens culture. Culture produces results. Look how your serve people and see why it matters.

## Character:
- a leader who says one thing but does another thing loses all credibility 
- “You can easily judge the character of a man by how he treats those who can do nothin for him
- We become smart because of those you surround yourself. If you’re in one group with very little view point diversity - everyone thinks the same way but if you seek our criticism and challenge you do get smart. Other ppl can often see you better than you can view them yourselfs
