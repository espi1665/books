# Crucial Conversations

## 1.0 
I finally got around to this book after 3+ years in my backlog. I'm 2/3 done, and I'm planning to listen to it again because there is so much info. Over the last year, I've had exponentially more crucial conversations; I wish I read this book earlier tbh. It's really helped me self-reflect, and gave me some simple strategies on how to improve in these difficult situations. Starting this series to share what I found powerful for those who don't have time to listen/read the entire book

**Turn a Victim into an Actor**
> Have you ever had a vicim mindset? You tell yourself/others this story where the other person did you wrong, and you intentionally leave out key details you did wrong to make yourself the victim... Pause because this is a clever story... Give all information to make it a useful story. Once it becomes a useful story you have areas where you can grow too via R.A.L.C (Recognize, admit, learn, change)

**Turn a Villain into a Human**
> Pause and ask - what is their intent of doing x,y,z? Same situation with with the clever story vs. useful story. Once we get the story right we need to remove these illogical theories that they are doing this to hurt you or others. Assume positive intent to turn them from a villain into a human

**Turn the Useless into the Able**
> What would you do right now if you wanted these results?

**Rabbit Hole Conversations**... Have you ever been in a meeting that was  intended to create a decision/outcome, but there one topic/small difference turned the conversation into a debate? This one topic/bullet point caused for multiple follow up meetings - my personal favorite type of meetings :upside_down_face:

Examples:
- Developers deep dive into solution mode during Sprint Planning/Grooming. Example reel in question:
> "Hey everyone, I love the passion but let's pause; we're not here to solution. Do we have enough information to give this story points?"

- When leadership deep dives into one bullet point. Build don't destroy:
> Instead of disagreeing with a bullet point which causes a debate, change your approach to a yes and conversation. Build onto the conversation/view point; don't tear it down.

Most disagreements start at the beginning or the end of a meeting. Here are a few tips:
- Always have an agenda
- Always start with context of why everyone is meeting
- Always end with a summary, assigned action items, and a timeline when to follow-up on the action items

The further I get into my career, the more realize the importance of communication. For those who don't know: I had my 3rd concussion in 2017 on the left side of my brain (communication side). I didn't properly give it time to heal, and for over a year I felt the symptoms: I'd lose my train of thought, and I struggled to keep my focus :disappointed:. Concussions are no joke - take them serious and give yourself ample time to heal. Thank you everyone who's joined me on this journey over the last few years.
Let's continue to grow together
