How Great Coaches Ask, Listen, and Empathize
- **Listening** - “Listen to understand but not to respond”
- **Empathy** -  is a skill that I personally have struggled with in the past until I read the book **Lost Art of Empathy** (free audio book rental on Libby). When someone would share a problem - I used to get into solution mode. That’s not what most want/need. Often they just need a someone to listen. It’s a simple and powerful change to go from - _“If you do X,Y,Z. You’ll feel better and back on your feet”_ vs. **“I can’t image what you’re going through. Please let me know if there’s anything I can do to help”**
