# The importance of giving your team Autonomy/Freedom

In Basketball, I've learned there are two ends to the bell curve: _Autonomy/Freedom_, or _structure/rules_. Both ends of the bell curve have their advantages + disadvantages.

> Autonomy/Freedom
- Pros:
  - Focuses on developing skills, and enables creativity through motion offense.
  - "position-less" basketball
- Cons
  - Can be Unorganized and can be chaotic. Can limit traditional team play possibility create "ball-hogs"

> Structure/Rules
- Pros
  - Focuses on execution and enables organized Spurs-like offense.
  - Clearly defined roles
- Cons:
  - Can have non-star players play like robots. Relies on players already being skilled.
  - Limits creativity from non-star players

In my playing career, my coaches were structure first and defensive focused. They called plays from the sideline. They clearly defined a good shot vs. bad shot. They pushed to have plays develop instead of players developing plays (EX:drive & kick). Every year our team was the best WE, but I never developed into the best ME which held back future WE's. This sparked my Autonomy/Freedom-first coaching style. I want players to call plays; I believe in my players to self-define a good shot vs. bad shot; I push players to be creative to develop plays. Every year I want my team to be the best WE and that also requires the best ME for each player :coach-kai:

I'm currently reading to Eleven Rings Success by Phil Jackson and I highly recommend it. After watching the last dance - I've grown appreciation for how he approaches the game :basketball:. He taught life lessons, and he coached in an innovative fashion. His triangle offense enabled freedom/creativity first with structure second. In his book he recites a quote from the Tao of Leadership on interfering as little as possible:

> Rules reduce freedom and responsibility. Enforcement of rules is manipulative which diminishes spontaneity and absorbs group energy. The more coercive you are the more resistant they are.

### Self-Reflection:
- When can you ask questions instead of giving answers?
  - Build problem solvers
- How can you ensure success will follow on your team/project without you?
  - Share knowledge. Enhance documentation
- Where can you give your team autonomy first and structure second?
