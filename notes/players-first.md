# Players First 
- John says season is about the team. Off season is about the individual 
- Volunteering - Noel did it by himself... that’s something that will never show up on the scoreboard 
- 1) nurturer: be patient and create successful environment 
- 2) protector: help guard them against themselves and others 
- 3) challenger: help them push through comfort levels. Be comfortable with being uncomfortable 
- 4) teacher: help them love their growth mindset 
- 5) promoter: put them on stage, if we lose it’s on me, if we win they get all the glory
- 6) father: unconditional love at all times
- Players first: I have to care more about their future than what people think about me
- Best test: do those served grow as persons? Do they while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves become servants 
- 2011/2012 - champions: AD +  Michael 1/2 draft picks but 3/4 on shots on the team. Team play, closeness and truly caring about others. Have to love playing together. Have to love being together.
- Surrender - believe what we’re telling you. 
- Often coddled - believe to get minutes, shots. They’re entitled 
- Not showtime, I don’t want you to impress the crowd. I want you to impress me. I’m you’re #1 fan
- Best teams don’t play for me. They play for each other 
- You can’t go into a game looking nervous or an anxious. As a leader you need to act - go into important meetings with a smile like you’re having the time of your life
- Work hard to improve your body language: facial expression, slouching, dropping head, how you sit, how you speak. Have the body language of a winner.  When you wanna slouch, stand up straight. When you wanna drop your head, hold it up high. When you feel wanna frown or , smile. When you feel like complaining, complement someone else. When someone corrects you, thank them because they care.
