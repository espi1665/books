# Scrum Master / Team Building Exercise

Today let's chat about good team building exercises. WHAT/WHY/HOW's. @Nick Borders ran this one last week and I found sparked a great conversation to bring us together as a team:

**Understanding our Values**
- Project the attached image
- Each team member pick 5 values and share them (~2mins)
- All values are presented to the team and then have Round-table where each member explains their values + why (~10mins)
- All values are aggregated together to have a conversation about the most common values across everyone. (~10mins)

**I found this exercise very valuable because...**
- It showed that regardless of the day-to-day's, bugs, issues, etc. that our core values are aligned
- It helped us learn more about each other and how we like to work :slightly_smiling_face:
- It helped spark self-reflection on how we can improve individually, and how our team can improve together
