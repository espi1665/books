Great teams aren't just made up of Stars. Great teams are made up of [talented teammates](https://www.potential.com/articles/5-important-reasons-why-teamwork-matters/).

Last season, my team struggled with team culture. On the bench, I often saw poor body language and disengagement. I saw this negative energy translate to the court. I decided to be intentional about changing this. Meyer Leonard is one of the best teammates in the NBA; when he's on the bench, he still finds a way to add value to his team. I did the below activity, and it was a catalyst that changed our team culture, and I'm proud to say we came together as a team after this

### Activity:
- I showed my team Nebraska basketball Team's Bench Highlights
- I asked everyone to describe the video in one word. Common themes were: Fun, Positive, Friendly, etc.
- I asked everyone to describe our bench in one word. Answers were much different
- "If you couldn't play at all would you be a valuable teammate everyday?" - Brad Stevens
- What can **you** do to be a better teammate?
