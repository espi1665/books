# Dangers of Envy

**Envy** is a very harmful; it encourages individuals to believe that what they lack in comparison to others accounts for their unhappiness. **Envy** puts unhappiness outside of control from the individual. Social media magnifies this: you can go on social media and compare yourselves and find:
- **LinkedIn** ==> more successful than you
- **Twitter** ==> funnier than you
- **Instagram** ==> have more fun than you

I saw this post from Chris Brickely one of the NBA's best Skills Trainers, and found it thought provoking. When you see others succeed, are you happy for them? Are your motivated by their success? Or do you resent them because they have what you want?
You are in control of how you treat others; you are in control of your growth; you are in control of your career path.

### Self-Reflection:
- How can you stop comparing yourself to others, and start comparing yourself to your past self?
- Check your phone screen time - set a goal to minimize your time on social media and hold yourself accountable
- What will you do with this extra ~15mins-1hr a day not on your phone? Maybe... go enjoy the nice weather this weekend?
