The Coaching Habit

- 5 to change: reason, trigger micro habit, effective practice and a plan
- Ask one question at a time
- Making coaching a daily habit. Often get, I don’t have time to coach. Everyone can coach by asking more questions and answering less
- Great starter question: so what’s on your mind?
- Ask a question with “for you” - helps ppl answer faster and more accurately. Studies prove this
- Ask questions with what instead of why.... why did you do that? Say what were you hoping for here?  Why did you think this was a good idea? What made you choose this course of action?
