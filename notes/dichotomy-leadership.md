= Dichotomy of Leadership

I’ve continued to look for new leadership philosophies to gather wisdom and knowledge. I learned about Jocko Willink on one of my favorite podcasts. He is a former US Navy SEAL, and really sparked my interest in military leadership. His book dives into examples from the battlefield and their consulting business to help leaders to understand the nuances in leadership and how to embrace the contradictions in leadership.

> The biggest and toughest dichotomy in leadership is to care deeply about your people, yet have to make decisions that may put them at risk for the wider mission. It's about building strong relationships with your team without letting your feelings stop you from doing what's necessary; it's about driving results without pushing too hard.

Leaders who get too emotionally-attached to people can't do their jobs effectively, e.g. failing to take people to task for bad behavior. On the other extreme, leaders who focus only on the mission may also hurt team morale and loyalty, e.g. overworking people with no regard for their well-being. Great leaders truly care for their people and feel responsible for their livelihood. The ultimate challenge is to balance between doing your best to take care of your team while being prepared to expose them to risks to achieve the mission. For combat leaders, such risks could literally involve life or death.
To continue on balance - **“All leadership characteristics can be taken too far”** - Jocko Willink. Here are some examples of extremes:
- If you are too confident - you are cocky; not confident enough - you are not strong.
- If you give too much autonomy - your team operates in chaos; not enough autonomy - you have a decision-making bottleneck
- If you have too much courage - you are reckless; not enough courage - you are not taking enough risks to help the team
- If you have too much communication - you are preventing your team from getting things done; too little communication - your team doesn’t have enough direction
- If you have too much constructive criticism - you’ll have a discouraged team member; too much support/encouragement - prevents growth

**Self-Reflection**
- What behaviors do you have that are out of balance? :balanceiseverything:
- What can you do to change those behaviors to gain balance? :zen:
