Basic Economics is a citizen’s guide to economics, written for those who want to understand how the economy works but have no interest in jargon or equations. Bestselling economist Thomas Sowell explains the general principles underlying different economic systems: capitalist, socialist, feudal, and so on. In readable language, he shows how to critique economic policies in terms of the incentives they create, rather than the goals they proclaim. With clear explanations of the entire field, from rent control and the rise and fall of businesses to the international balance of payments, this is the first book for anyone who wishes to understand how the economy functions.

[9 Lessons from Basics Economics](https://jackyangzzh.medium.com/lessons-from-basic-economics-by-thomas-sowell-a1dc2505cd57)

2. The market can adjust itself through price.
3. Money creates incentives
4. Competition is good for the economy

6. Risk pays
6. Policies often have unintended long term consequences
7. Politicians usually only consider short term results
8. Government still plays an important role
9. Connectedness is important for the economy

Notes:
- Money provides incentives for businesses to become more efficient and scarce resources to not go extinct. In other words, money helps people to choose certain actions over the other and it helps the market to adjust itself. When prices are artifically controlled, demand goes up and supplies don’t have the incentive to provide high-quality services. For example, under rent control, by keeping rent below a certain price point, landlords no longer have the incentive to provide good housing conditions.
- Money provides incentives for individuals
- Trickle down economics theory has never been accepted amoung economists. The free market is about distributing anything to anybody. It's about letting people earn what they can from voluntary transations from other people
- Tax cuts aren't "trickle down" (straw man argument). When a company is started, first they pay for supplies/equipment, labor, and taxes. Whatever is left is profit. Profit isn't guarenteed, a more correct term would be trickle up, because no matter what labor will get paid, otherwise they will go find another job
- When businesses aren't hampered by taxation policcies, they have the ability to create additional wealth
- "Moralizing is easier than facing hard facts." Individuals often have a assumption of an given outcome, then only look for data that supports their argument. When facts are presented, individuals often ignore or write those facts off
- America donates to phliophanphy several times Europe… charable donation… 3x Sweden, France Japan percentage… what someone chooses to do with extra wealth is individual choice 
- “Both private and public sectors and always values some people are worthy enough that others should have to pay for them, but not worthy enough they have to pay for themselves. Weighing some values over other values is No where more common that discussion government policies. Taxing away what others earns to finance others own moral adventures for social programs is often depicted as humanitarian, while allowing others freedom as one self so they can make their own choices is “allowing greed”…. 
- Only private companies are blamed for greed… This argument ignores basic economics, and can be equally applied to the government. The government is more greed than “profits”
- Fairness… Have two definitions, and
    - “everyone plays by the same rules is judged by the same standards and is rewarded for the same criteria.”
    - “everyone has equal prospects of achieving the same goal, whether that is winning, surviving, or gaining a different benefit or reward.”
- “Pay your fair share”, etc… “fair trade”… "Fair" is more valuable term for politicans during election time than it is for economics.
  - If you don’t care about something, you likely don’t want to succeed in it as much as others. Tall ppl advantage in basketball. By both definitions, this isn't "fair"
