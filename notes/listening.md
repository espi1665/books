# Listening

Communication is arguably one of the most important skills in life. Good communication skills can be the difference between understanding information more accurately and quickly vs. poor communication can lead to misunderstandings and frustration. The root of communication is listening.
> I really enjoyed yesterdays #cop-coactive meetup where we dove into the different levels of listening and got an opportunity to put it in practice.

- **Level 1** The focus is on me. When you listen at level 1 you are listening with the intent to respond.
- **Level 2** focuses on the other person. Level 2 is when you listen for what someone is saying beneath their words.
- **Level 3** focus on the energy. When you listen at level 3 you’re getting a feel for what’s happening and using all your senses.
This is a great way to breakdown different kinds of listening, and it clearly defines that listening is not just with your ears but all of your senses. This is something I wish I learned a long time ago, but I’m glad I know about now and I can teach this to my teams :coactive:

**Self-Reflection**
- Why does only listening in level 1 not foster relationships?
- How/when/who can you listen more in level 2 and level 3?
