# The Coaching Habit

In management, there are so many responsibilities/tasks to work with peers/superiors that it's a full-time job. That's before even interacting with your team!!! Often times, coaching your team is the first thing to get dropped due to time-restraints due to being "too busy."

For those of you who have the aspirations to coach your team, but struggle to making Coaching a Daily Habit - I have a great book suggestion...
- The Coaching Habit: Say Less, Ask More & Change the Way You Lead Forever

I personally swapped my podcasts for audiobooks over the last month, and it's been a nice change of pace. Podcasts are awesome, and I've learned a lot from them - on the flip-side audiobooks dive deeper into specific topics I'm interested in learning. It's like lifting free weights vs. machines. It's important to balance both, because they have different pros/cons

### Reflection:
- What can you do to make Coaching a Daily Habit?
- When can you answer less, and ask more?
- How can you ask better questions?


- 5 to change: reason, trigger micro habit, effective practice and a plan
- Ask one question at a time
- Making coaching a daily habit. Often get, I don’t have time to coach. Everyone can coach by asking more questions and answering less
- Great starter question: so what’s on your mind?
- Ask a question with “for you” - helps ppl answer faster and more accurately. Studies prove this
- Ask questions with what instead of why.... why did you do that? Say what were you hoping for here?  Why did you think this was a good idea? What made you choose this course of action?
