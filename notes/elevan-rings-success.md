# Elevan Rings Success


## Eleven Rings Success by Phil Jackson 

Every year Phil Jackson gives all if his team members/staff a book going into the off-season and has a 1:1 meeting when they re-group the next fall. He selects books that he thinks they would enjoy, learn from, make them laugh or smile, or just end up collecting dust on a shelf. He's aware not everyone is going to read, but sometimes all it takes is one to make a difference between winning a championship and falling just short. My athletic director follows this concept with his entire coaching staff and it's helped me grow a lot

--------------------------
Why not you? CFE discussions just ended - why not adopt this yourself? That budget that you have for team events is just chilling there - why not send your team audiobooks/books and have a discussion at CFE season this summer? 




## Today's message is around fear/anxiety/anger and Why Mindfulness is a major key

Phil Jackson mentioned in his book:

> Players have the ability to detach themselves after a long grueling game. Coaches don't. I often find myself at the highest level of adrenaline/anxiety in the middle of the night. My mind is restless - should I have ran this play? Made this substitution? Called a timeout after x,y,z?; etc... It often takes me hours get back in balance and calm my mind through meditation.

I can relate to Phil in many ways. 2020 was the year of fear, and Yoda said it best: “Fear is the path to the dark side … **fear leads** to anger … **anger leads** to hate … **hate leads** to suffering.”
Your life will never be without **problems**. For each problem you solve a new problem will be created on the foundation of the solution to the last problem. Without mindfulness, getting overwhelmed by these problems is common. [Coach Phil Jackson taught his team mindfulness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqz7R-QalqY). Having the ability to calm your mind when you face difficult problems is more important than ever.
