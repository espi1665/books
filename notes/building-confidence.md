# Building Confidence

Today's videos/articles are all about how to improve confidence. Many of you may relate to my personal journey with confidence issues. In various times in my life I've been too confident, and not confident enough. I've come a long way but this will be a journey for the rest of my life.

In my experience coaching the youth of today, I've noticed confidence issues are 2x/3x as common as they were 10+ years ago... Everyone needs to a) go through their confidence journey b) be a confidence giver not a confidence taker.
