= **How to Win Friends & Influence People**

This book as been in my backlog for a long time and I’m finally getting to it - thanks to various factors including feedback, and Charisma’s on Command’s latest video. I’m not an expert on this topic; I’m hoping to learn, share what I find powerful, put it to practice, and repeat in hopes of changing a weakness into a strength. I’ve heard many testimonials that lessons from this book have changed lives for the better.
> “I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement. There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticism from superiors. I never criticize anyone.” - Charles Schwab

**Self Reflection:**
- How can you give someone at work, family, and friends appreciation and encouragement today?
- Why do you think giving appreciation is important to make a daily habit?
