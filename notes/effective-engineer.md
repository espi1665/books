# The Effective Engineer

- [The Effective Engineer | Edmond Lau | Talks at Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnIz7H5ruy0)

I was recommended Edmond Lau and I was blown away. Regardless of you role in technology or where you are in your career, you can learn something from his talk. I’ve added his book The Effective Engineer to my backlog.

>The most effective engineers — the ones who have risen to become distinguished engineers and leaders at their companies — can produce 10 times the impact of other engineers, but they're not working 10 times the hours.
>They've internalized a mindset that took me years of trial and error to figure out. I'm going to share that mindset with you — along with hundreds of actionable techniques and proven habits — so you can shortcut those years.

### 1. Optimize for learning
- You own your story.
- If you grow 1% everyday you’ll be 37x better in one year
- Make a habit out of improving every single day
### 2. Invest in iteration speed
- Write tools to help you increase your speed
- Rule of thumb: If you have to do a task manual 2x - automate it for the third time.
### 3. Validate your ideas aggressively and iteratively
- Experiment-driven product design is a powerful tool
- Incrementally validating your assumptions is high leverage
- Hypothesis testing
- Do the scariest part first (the one with the most unknowns / risk)
### 4. Minimise operational burden
- Do the simple thing first. Ask: what’s the simplest solution to this problem?
- Be stringent about cutting sources of complexity (go watch “simple made easy” by Rich Hickey)
- Beware of the hidden costs of complexity - code, system, product, organizational complexity
### 5. Build a great engineering culture
- engineering enjoy working in environments that focus on high-leverage activities
