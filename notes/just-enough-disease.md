This is something that is all too common in Sports. A team wins a championship, a player gets a contract, or a player wins an award - they get to a place where their comfortable then they coast... (Mo Harkless :blazers-2017:) - Why is that??? This individual has what Tripp calls the "Just Enough Disease" or a "Prey Mentality" - They're only motivated to move when somethings chasing them down...

However, the best of the best are always hungry. The best of the best are always working on their craft. The best of the best are always asking how can I get one step ahead? :jordan:

### Self Reflection:
- When have you experienced the "Just Enough Disease"?
- How can you focus on growth and always stay hungry?
- If you're facing burnout - how can you refuel your tank?
- How can you breakdown your outcome goals into process orientated goals?
