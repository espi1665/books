# Dare to Lead

Each time I meet with a new mentor, I always ask what resources they recommend... One of the most common resources suggestions is Brené Brown. Over winter break, I finally read Dare to Lead - and I highly recommend this book.

Now that 2021 is over... Let's refresh on **fear**... If you struggle recognizing your fear, you are likely not addressing the **fear** properly, and thus likely showing up as an Armored Leader.

### Self-Reflection:
- In what ways do you show up as an Armored Leader?
- In what ways can you drop the armor to become a better daring leader???


## Thought of the Day:

> "Fear is the path to the dark side… Fear leads to anger… anger leads to hate… hate leads to suffering." - Yoda

2020 has been the year of **fear**. Whether it's the **fear** of losing your income; the **fear** of your mortality; or the **fear** of the unknown. We and those around us have all faced **fear**, and it's lead to suffering around the world. A great leader should never lead through **fear**, because of this.

### Self Reflection 
- When did you face fear, and how do you handle it?
- How do you help guide your team/family/friends through their fear?
