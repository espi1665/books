# Dare to Lead

Each time I meet with a new mentor, I always ask what resources they recommend... One of the most common resources suggestions is Bren√© Brown. Over winter break, I finally read Dare to Lead - and I highly recommend this book.

Brene Brown: [What's the Difference Between Fear and 'Armor'?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LbI19ZiMlI)

Now that 2021 is over... Let's refresh on **fear**... If you struggle recognizing your fear, you are likely not addressing the **fear** properly, and thus likely showing up as an Armored Leader.

### Self-Reflection:
- In what ways do you show up as an Armored Leader?
- In what ways can you drop the armor to become a better daring leader???
